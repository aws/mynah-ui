**Mynah UI** is a **_data and event_** driven chat interface designed for browsers and webviews on IDEs or any platform supporting the latest web technologies. It is utilized by Amazon Q for [VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AmazonWebServices.aws-toolkit-vscode) and [JetBrains](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/11349-aws-toolkit--amazon-q-codewhisperer-and-more), and is included with the AWS Toolkit extension.

Mynah UI operates independently of any framework or UI library, enabling seamless integration into any web-based project. This design choice ensures high configurability for theming, supporting various use cases. It functions as a standalone solution, requiring only a designated rendering location within the DOMTree.

### Setup, configuration and use

To set up your local development environment quickly, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will:
1. **Clean**: Remove existing `dist` and `node_modules` directories to ensure you're working with a fresh environment.
2. **Install**: Reinstall all necessary dependencies for both the main project and the example project.
3. **Build**: Compile the project using Webpack in production mode.
4. **Start Example**: Install dependencies and build the example project, then start the development server with `watch` mode enabled. The project will be served on `localhost:9000` using `live-server`.
5. **Watch**: Start the main project in `watch` mode.
After running this command, any changes you make will automatically rebuild and refresh your development environment, allowing you to work seamlessly.
